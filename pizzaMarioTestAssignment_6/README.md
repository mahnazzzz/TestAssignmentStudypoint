You can finde assignment [her](https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2019spring-test/blob/master/Assignments/06%20TDD%20assignment.pdf)

We should practice Getting into the Test-driven development, TDD does have some benefits:

- This will make sure we don't forget to write the test
- This allows the programmer to know exactly what their code should output
- Writing a test before each code increases the test coverage of the program to 5%, thus reducing the likelihood of an error in future development.
- TDD make possible to see whether each piece of code written meets expectations or whether new code is a problem with older software components. Or not.
